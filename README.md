## Migration Strategy

Flask and Sinatra run side by side during migration. Functionality is moved route by route – read-only endpoints first, authentication and write logic later. Both versions share the same SQLite database in the interim.

## Setup

### Ruby / Sinatra
```bash
cd ruby-sinatra
bundle config set --local path vendor/bundle
bundle install
bundle exec ruby app.rb

### Python / Flask (Legacy)
```bash
cd python-legacy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

App runs on `http://localhost:5000`
